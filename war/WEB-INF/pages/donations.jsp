						Built to be a free resource for education, CalcU does not make itself or its owners any revenue.  
						Users never have to pay (nor will they ever) to access any features on the website, 
						as it is our goal to make education accessible to all. However, we are spending a small amount of money to 
						maintain the website and pay hosting fees. We also have some goals for the future of the site that 
						are big and will require a lot of work, including automatically generated practice tests, and better algorithms for recommendations.
						We have dedicated the entire summer to working on this project and hope to sustain the website 
						through the generosity of people who appreciate it. If you are able to support the project,
						we would really appreciate it!
