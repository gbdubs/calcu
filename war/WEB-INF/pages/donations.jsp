						Built primarily to promote free learning for all, CalcU is a non-profit website.  Users never have to pay 
						to access any features on the website, as it is our goal to make education accessible to all.  While we pledge 
						never to change our mission statement we now need funds in order to maintain the website and pay hosting fees.
						We have dedicated the entire summer to working on this project and hope to sustain the website through donations. 
						Any and all donations are greatly appreciated!

						You can donate by going to our Kickstarter or by <a href="http:/contact">contacting us</a>.
