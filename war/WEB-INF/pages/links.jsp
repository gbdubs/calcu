						CalcU attempts to make learning Calculus as easy as it can be.  That being said, this website isn't for everyone, and it is impossible
						to include the wide range of materials that are available on the web.  This page contains sites, textbooks, practice problems, video lectures,
						online courses, and a whole range of materials that you might find useful on your journey through learning Calculus.  If you have a favorite
						resource that hasn't been listed on this page, please contact us with a link to it, so that other people can profit from the information you 
						have!
					</p>
					<p>
						Finally, remember that there is no correct or incorrect way to learn. That has been one of the formative missions of this site, in that we
						want to make this large subject universally applicable and understandable to people with different levels of interest, experience, and skill
						in Calculus. If you have found this site helpful, that is great! But our main goal is directing people to the resources which will
						best aid them, and it is important to recognize that that won't always be our site.
					</p>
					<p>
						Best of Luck on Your Journey!

									These free courses are offered by professionals in mathematics education. Many are self paced, and have their content available on your schedule. These are not recommended for those who already have a structured course in 
									their life, but they can be a stellar resource for providing a schedule and order to the information for those who want it.

									Often the most helpful thing we can have is someone explain a specific concept to us. Luckily, organizations have started to see the value in more example oriented demonstrations of what things mean and how they are used.
									A number of these organizations offer amazing support for all aspects of calculus, and using these resources can be hugely helpful when there is a specific area of study you want to hone in on.
