							We scrape the web to aggregate Calculus resources from different sources into one web-app that is interactive, collaborative and easy to use.
							Now, there is no need to keep searching for the answer to your question in different places. If the answer isn't on this site, it probably isn't out there.
							You can contribute to the site by expanding asking questions and answering them, an interactivity that furthers the depth of knowledge on the web.

							Our database of thousands of calculus questions, practice problems, and explanations adaptively curates itself to fit your needs.
							While you use the site, you are providing us with feedback on how you learn, and this allows us to provide better resources to you in the future.
							This system of feedback-driven recommendation is what makes CalcU successful, and what will allow it to learn over time.

							A secondary goal of CalcU is to become a site where researchers can conduct anonymous studies of how learners learn,

							what will hopefully become studies on learning processes and recommendation techniques!

							Whether you rocked that practice problem, or found it a bit too difficult, CalcU will recommend other resources to check out,
							based on your profile and your history with similar problems.  This system can quickly figure out where you are, and how to help
							you figure out your roadmap to a greater level of understanding.
