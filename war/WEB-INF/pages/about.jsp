									research that will create better educational experiences in the future for others.

					<div class="box-body">
					<p> 
						CalcU was started by Grady Ward, a Brandeis Junior, as an independent study in educational
						technology.  After a successful alpha launch, CalcU was able to expand thanks to the SPARK
						Program, which provides funding to explore new and promising ideas that incorporate social
						justice into their missions. After receiving a SPARK grant, Grady enlisted the aid of fellow 
						Brandeis peers Sofiya Semenova, Roger LaCroix, Danny Smyda, and Russell Santos.

									Lead Developer/Team Leader
								</h4>
								<p>
									Grady is the founder of CalcU. He attends Brandeis University, and can usually
									be found running somewhere (literally or proverbially). He is interested in 
									research in computer science and has worked in educational technology, graph
									isomorphism, image processing, and web design. He loves to teach, and this project
									has been a phenomenal chance to do that in every way.
