							We would like to extend a HUGE Thank You to the SPARK Grant Program 
							(through the Office of Technology Licensing at <b>Brandeis University</b>), 
							whose generosity made it possible to take this project from a proof of concept
							into a fully fledged website, full of the features and connectivity we wanted
							to pursue. Their contribution allowed us to access more resources (particularly
							the non-technical) and expand our team. Thank you for making our work possible,

							project from the very start, and has been key in bringing this website to life.
							Her unparalleled experience as a Mathematics educator shaped the site in too 
							many ways to count, and her support in pursuing the further development of the
							project allowed us to take our site from an independent project to a reality.
							Thank you for everything.
