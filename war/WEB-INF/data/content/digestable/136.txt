Use the given data to calculate \\(M_n\\) for the largest possible value of \\(n\\) to approximate the integral you stated in (a).  Do you think \\(M_n\\) over- or under-estimates the exact value of the integral?  Why?\nc. Approximate the integral stated in (a) by calculating \\(S_n\\) for the largest possible value of \\(n\\), based on the given data.\nd. Compute \\(\\frac{1}{60} S_n\\) and \\(\\frac{2000+2100+2400+3000+3900+5100+6500}{7}\\).  What quantity do both of these values estimate?  Which is a more accurate approximation?\n\n\u003cimg src\u003d\"/_static/img/content/10186.png\"/\u003e",
