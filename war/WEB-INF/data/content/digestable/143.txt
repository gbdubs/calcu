Let g be the function given by the rule g(x) \u003d |x|, and let f be the graph shown.\n(a) Reasoning visually, explain why g is differentiable at every point x such that x \\(\\neq\\) 0.\n(b) Use the limit definition of the derivative to show that g\u0027(0) \u003d \\(\\lim_{h \\to 0}\\) \\(\\frac{|h|}{h}\\).\n(c) Explain why g\u0027(0) fails to exist by using small positive and negative values of h.\n(d) State all values of a for which f is not differentiable at x \u003d a.  For each, provide a reason for your conclusion.\n(e) True or false: if a function p is differentiable at x \u003d b, then \\(\\lim_{x \\to b}\\) p(x) must exist.
