The length of the semimajor axis (that is, half of the major axis) is defined to be 1 astronomical unit (AU). The vertices of the elliptical orbit are given special names: \u0027aphelion\u0027 is the vertex farthest from the sun, and \u0027perihelion\u0027 is the vertex closest to the sun.

However, much like with circles and horizontal parabolas,we can split an ellipse into a top half and a bottom half, each of which would indeed represent y as a function of x. Use your calculator to graph the ellipses given in Exercise 1-8 above.
