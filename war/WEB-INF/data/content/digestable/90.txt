      "title": "Matrices in Pedimaxus",
      "body": "Consider the following scenario. In the small village of Pedimaxus in the country of Sasquatchia, all 150 residents get one of the two local newspapers. Market research has shown that in any given week, 90% of those who subscribe to the Pedimaxus Tribune want to keep getting it, but 10% want to switch to the Sasquatchia Picayune. Of those who receive the Picayune, 80% want to continue with it and 20% want switch to the Tribune. We can express this situation using matrices. Specifically, let X be the _state matrix_ given by \\( X \u003d \\left[ \\begin{array}{r} T \\\\ P \\end{array} \\right] \\) where T is the number of people who get the Tribune and P is the number of people who get the Picayune in a given week.  Let Q be the `transition matrix\u0027 given by \\(Q \u003d \\left[ \\begin{array}{rr} 0.90 \u0026 0.20 \\\\ 0.10 \u0026 0.80 \\end{array} \\right]\\) such that QX will be the state matrix for the next week. \n\n a. Let_s assume that when Pedimaxus was founded, all 150 residents got the Tribune. (Let_s call this Week 0.) This would mean \\( X \u003d \\left[ \\begin{array}{r} 150 \\\\ 0 \\end{array} \\right] \\) Since 10% of that 150 want to switch to the Picayune, we should have that for Week 1, 135 people get the Tribune and 15 people get the Picayune.  Show that QX in this situation is indeed \\(QX \u003d \\left[ \\begin{array}{r} 135 \\\\ 15 \\end{array} \\right]\\)\n\nb. Assuming that the percentages stay the same, we can get to the subscription numbers for Week 2 by computing Q2X. How many people get each paper in Week 2?\n\nc. Explain why the transition matrix does what we want it to do.",
