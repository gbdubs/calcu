The curve  \\(y \u003d f(x)\\)  (for  \\(a \\le x \\le b\\) ) has been rotated about the  \\(x\\) -axis.    You set up a partition  \\((x_0,x_1,\\dots,x_n)\\)  of  \\([a,b]\\)  and approximate the surface area of the resulting solid by connecting consecutive points  \\(\\bigl(x_{k-1},f(x_{k-1})\\bigr)\\)  and  \\(\\bigl(x_k,f(x_k)\\bigr)\\)  by a straight line segment, which, when rotated about the  \\(x\\) -axis, produces a portion of a cone.

Fred thinks they all probably copied from the person who made the original mistake.
