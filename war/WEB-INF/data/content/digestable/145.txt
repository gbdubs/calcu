      "body": "A certain amount of gas is trapped in a cylinder with a piston. The ideal gas law from thermodynamics says that if the cylinder is not heated and if the piston moves slowly then one has pV \u003d CT where p is the pressure in the gas, V is its volume, T its temperature (in degrees Kelvin) and C is a constant depending on the amount of gas  trapped in the cylinder.\n(a) If the pressure is 10psi (pounds per square inch), if the volume is 25 inches\\(^{3}\\), and if the piston is moving so that the gas volume is expanding at a rate of 2 inches\\(^{3}\\) per minute, then what is the rate of change of the pressure?\n(b) The ideal gas law turns out to be only approximately true. A more accurate description of gases is given by van der Waals\u0027 equation of state, which says that (p+\\(\\frac{a}{V^{2}}\\))(V-b)\u003dC where a, b, C are constants depending on the temperature and the amount and type of gas in the cylinder. \nSuppose that the cylinder contains fictitious gas for which one has a \u003d 12 and b \u003d 3. Suppose that at some moment the volume of gas is 12 in\\(^{3}\\), the pressure is 25psi and suppose the gas is expanding at 2 inches\\(^{3}\\) per minute. Then how fast is the pressure changing?",
