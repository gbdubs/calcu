You can run a speed \\(\\textit{v}_{1}\\) on land and at a slower speed \\(\\textit{v}_{2}\\) in the water. Your perpendicular distance from the side of the pool is \\(\\textit{a}\\), the child\u0027s perpendicular distance is \\(\\textit{b}\\), and the distance along the side of the pool between the closest point to you and the closest point to the child is \\(\\textit{c}\\) (see the figure). Without stopping to do any calculus, you instinctively choose the quickest route (shown in the figure) and save the child. Our purpose is to derive a relation between the angle \\(\\theta_{1}\\) your path makes with the perpendicular to the side of the pool when you\u0027re on land, and the angle \\(\\theta_{2}\\) your path makes with the perpendicular when you\u0027re in the water. To do this, let \\(\\textit{x}\\) be the distance between the closest point to you at the side of the pool and the point where you enter the water. Write the total time you run (on land and in the water) in terms of \\(\\textit{x}\\) (and also the constants \\(\\textit{a}, \\textit{b}, \\textit{c}, \\textit{v}_{1}, \\textit{v}_{2}\\)). Then set the derivative equal to zero. The result, called \"Snell\u0027s law\" or the \"law of refraction,\" also governs the bending of light when it goes into water.\n\n\u003cimg src\u003d\"/_static/img/content/20175.png\"/\u003e",
