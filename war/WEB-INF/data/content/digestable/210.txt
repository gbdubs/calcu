      "title": "Determining Distance Traveled From Velocity",
      "body": "Suppose that a person is walking in such a way that her velocity varies slightly according to the information given in the table below and graph given.\n(a) Using the grid, graph, and given data appropriately, estimate the distance traveled by the walker during the two hour interval from t \u003d 0 to t \u003d 2.  You should use time intervals of width \\(\\triangle\\) t \u003d 0.5$, choosing a way to use the function consistently to determine the height of each rectangle in order to approximate distance traveled.\n(b) How could you get a better approximation of the distance traveled on [0,2]?  Explain, and then find this new estimate.\n(c) Now suppose that you know that v is given by \\(v(t) \u003d 0.5t^{3}-1.5t^{2}+1.5t+1.5\\). Remember that v is the derivative of the walker\u0027s position function, s.  Find a formula for s so that s\u0027 \u003d v.\n(d) Based on your work in (c), what is the value of s(2) - s(0)?  What is the meaning of this quantity?\n\n\u003cimg src\u003d\"http://www.calcu.education/_static/img/content/4/20414.PNG\"/\u003e",
