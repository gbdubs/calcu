The growth of the population is described by the differential equation \\(\\frac{dP}{dt} \u003d f(P) \u003d P(6-P)\\).\n\na. Sketch a graph of \\(f(P) \u003d P(6-P)\\) and use it to determine the equilibrium solutions and whether they are stable or unstable.

Suppose now that the owners of the lake allow fishers toremove 1000 fish from the lake every month (remember that \\(P(t)\\) is measured in thousands of fish.  Modify the differential equation to take this into account.  Sketch the new graph of \\(dP/dt\\) versus \\(P\\).  Determine the new equilibrium solutions and decide whether they are stable or unstable. \nc. Given the situation in part (b), give a description of the long-term behavior of the fish population.\nd. Suppose that fishermen remove \\(h\\) thousand fish per month. How is the differential equation modified? \ne. What is the largest number of fish that can be removed per month without eliminating the fish population?  If fish are removed at this maximum rate, what is the eventual population of fish?",

In this problem, temperature is  measured in degrees Fahrenheit and time in minutes.\n\na. Two calculus students, Alice and Bob, enter a 70\\(^\\circ\\) classroom at the same time.  Each has a cup of coffee that is 100\\(^\\circ\\).  The differential equation for Alice has a constant of proportionality \\(k\u003d0.5\\), while the constant of proportionality for Bob is \\(k\u003d0.1\\). What is the initial rate of change for Alice\u0027s coffee? What is the initial rate of change for Bob\u0027s coffee?\nb. What feature of Alice�s and Bob�s cups of coffee could explain this difference?\nc. As the heating unit turns on and off in the room, the temperature in the room is \\(T_r\u003d70+10\\sin t\\)  Implement Euler\u0027s method with a step size of \\(\\Delta t \u003d 0.1\\) to approximate the temperature of Alice\u0027s coffee over the time interval \\(0\\leq t\\leq 50\\).
